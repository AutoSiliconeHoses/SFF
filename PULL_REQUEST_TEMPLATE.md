I recommend not using this system unless you're using it as a demonstration of bad code.
 Or if you wanna try and make it better, that'd be great. 

If you're going for the latter:
 
1. Please mention what file 

2. Please mention what line of code
 
3. Explain your changes
4. Explain how it's better
