Open this in Atom for a happy little surprise.

These are completely experimental.
We have two methods of using Windows PowerShell to our advantage.

We're using PowerShell because
  + It's like using VBS, CMD and .NET all at once.
  + Let's me use commands like 'ls' instead of 'dir' cause I'm all about that Linux lyf. 🤙
  + Can be run from JavaScript, EASY.
  + Used by professionals
  + Loads of Scripts are premade.
  + And it's  b l u e 🔵
  - Isn't Green

METHOD #1 - Outlook Scraper
  + Works (Downloads files) 👏👏👏
  ~ Uses Outlook and MAPI (I'm not sure how I feel about that) 😒
  - Works too well (Downloads EVERY file. Even images. Even ones from ages ago.)

METHOD #2 - EWS
  + Is preferred Method by professionals (Cos we is totes pro)
  + Uses Microsoft Exchange WebServices
  - I have no clue what that is
  - Massive Script
  - Loads of Syntax errors that don't exist
  - Doesn't work at all
  - Requires the company to be running off of Exchange, which they're not
